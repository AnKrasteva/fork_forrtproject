## Existing educational materials

Make your existing teaching and mentoring materials open. These can in about prototypical subject-matters like in areas within Psychology, Political Science, Statistics, Economics, Neuroscience, Philosophy, History, etc. These can be in any language. You can then iteratively improve you materials. Non-exhaustive examples are: enhacing its documentation, adding media (transcripts, voice, video), making it multilanguage, and accessible to people with disability. The goal is to make your materials as understandable as possible to others, so they can be useful for both learning and teaching purposes. Other educators can then reuse and/or adapt it to their own context and needs - reducing time encumberment for producing high-quality materials and its access - effectively allowing meaningful participation of civil society in learning, research and innovation.

## Past and current research materials

Make your research open. An often neglected aspect is that your research serves the community as an educational material. Increasingly, well documented research repositories are used in undergraduate and graduate education. Think of the Collaborative Replications and Education Project in Psychology (CREP), the Political Science Replication Initiative (PSRI), its Economics’ counterpart. How to achieve this? Thankfully, it is very easy. Create an OSF account, include your studies’ materials (code, codebooks, data, etc) in a repository, and you are done!
