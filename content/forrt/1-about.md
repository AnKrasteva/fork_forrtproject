# Mission & Aims

## FORRT's goals in a nutshell:

* We hope FORRT will kickstart start a conversation on, and advocate for, placing greater support and value in teaching and mentoring – including raising the profile of open teaching materials and recognising their value.
* We hope FORRT ...
* We hope FORRT will be a useful tool supporting teachers looking to integrate open and reproducible research practices in their courses. For this we provide a pedagogy for incremental implementation of  

To achieve our goals, and in line with principles enshrined in FORRT, its manuscript will become an open online contributorship project, wherein the work of those supporting OS pedagogies are valued and formally recognized. The same can be said about any contribution to the construction, improvement and maintenance of FORRT's website. With this, we hope to expand the scope and diversity of FORRT’s mission and its team. [Join us in this mission](https://forrtv2.netlify.com/getinvolved).

With FORRT, educators in higher-education have an unprecedented opportunity to shape the minds and future of the consumers of science and the next generation of academics. Numerous scholars consider as a significant part of their responsibilities to contribute to the next generations’ edification and professional development – _i.e._, broadening their horizons, imparting expertise into the acquisition of knowledge independently, fostering the conditions to discover connections of seemingly unrelated phenomena, helping develop the tools and self-confidence necessary to challenge outdated dogma and its roots on current societal and educational institutions. We hope FORRT will help educators in these goals. In this sense, at its best, FORRT should be the answer to the question **_“what are the best conceivable educational practices in higher education and how to achieve it?”_**
