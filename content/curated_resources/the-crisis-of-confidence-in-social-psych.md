Difficulties in conducting research, unfulfilled expectations about research payoffs, and outside pressures had all contributed to a sense of crisis. Relief may come from acceptance of theoretical and methodological pluralism, from reevaluation of research expectations and ethical stances, and from the development of realistic responses to societal demands.",
