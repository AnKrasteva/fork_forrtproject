        "Abstract":"Calls for public access to research data have been ongoing for some time. For instance, in their \u201cRecommendations for Secure Storage and Availability of Digital Primary Research Data\u201d (2009) the German Research Foundation (\u201cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\u201d, DFG) demanded that publicly funded data are freely available after the completion of a project. In line with this, in 2010 the Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany called for long-term storage of and generally free access to research data. In September 2015, the DFG published data management guidelines that affirmed these goals and asked research associations to consider their data management regulations and to develop appropriate standards for discipline-specific use and sharing of research data. The German Psychological Society (DGPs) joins the DFG and the Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany in their mission to specify the DFG guidelines for the field of psychology. This document (a) emphasizes the importance of sustainable research data management, (b) defines what \u201cprimary data\u201d are and how they should be stored, (c) defines standards and potential data sharing restrictions, and (d) defines the rights and duties of researchers that share data and researchers that use secondary data. The German Psychological Associations adopted these recommendations in September 2016.",
