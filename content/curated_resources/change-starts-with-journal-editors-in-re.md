The replicability crisis in psychology is summarized in terms of three focal issues: the \u201cfile drawer\u201d problem, lack of replication studies, and the null hypothesis significance testing paradigm. The authors argue that journal editors are uniquely positioned to address all three of these problems via the adoption of new policies for review and publication.",
