    "abstract": "Project TIER (Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research) promotes the integration of principles and practices related to transparency and replicability in the research training of social scientists. We develop methods and tools for enhancing research transparency that are specially designed to serve the needs of undergraduate and graduate students, and disseminate them to faculty who teach courses on quantitative methods or supervise student research, as well as to students interested in adopting them independently. Our goal is to reach a day in which training in research transparency becomes standard and ubiquitous in the education of social scientists.",
