        "Abstract":"Examines several prominent trends in the conduct of psychological research and considers how they may limit progress in the field. Failure to appreciate important differences in temperament among researchers, and differences in the particular talents researchers bring to their work have prevented the development in psychology of a vigorous tradition of fruitful theoretical inquiry. Misplaced emphasis on quantitative \"productivity,\" a problem for all disciplines, is shown to have particularly unfortunate results in psychology. Problems associated with the distorting effects of seeking grant support are shown to interact with the first two difficulties. Finally, the distorting effects of certain kinds of experimental studies are discussed, together with their implications for progress in this field.",
