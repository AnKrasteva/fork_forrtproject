    "abstract": "Introduction to simulation - first of a series of short lectures given at University of Oxford in February 2021. Very basic for those with little or no background, starting with simulation in Excel. In part 1, we simulate random data to show how easy it is to get a 'significant' effect if you adopt methods of p-hacking. In part 2, we simulate data with a real group difference and show how you can fail to find the effect in a sample if you have insufficient statistical power. For full course description see: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yt1m... Sorry - no in-person follow-up available on YouTube, but I hope you find the lectures useful.",
