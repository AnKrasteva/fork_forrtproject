    "abstract": "This article offers a short guide to the steps scientists can take to ensure that their data and associated analyses continue to be of value and to be recognized. In just the past few years, hundreds of scholarly papers and reports have been written on questions of data sharing, data provenance, research reproducibility, licensing, attribution, privacy, and more\u2014but our goal here is not to review that literature. Instead, we present a short guide intended for researchers who want to know why it is important to \u201ccare for and feed\u201d data, with some practical advice on how to do that. The final section at the close of this work (Links to Useful Resources) offers links to the types of services referred to throughout the text.",
