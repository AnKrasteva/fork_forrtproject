        "Abstract":"Because physical theories typically predict numerical values, an improvement in experimental precision reduces the tolerance range and hence increases corroborability. In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1\/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by \"success\" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. \"Statistical significance\" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental \"cuteness\" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.",
