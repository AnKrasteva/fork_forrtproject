The young one talks constantly of escape, and, after a few months, he makes a break. He's gone a week, and then he's brought back by the guards. He's half dead, crazy with hunger and thirst. He describes how awful it was to the old prisoner. The endless stretches of sand, no oasis, no signs of life anywhere. The old prisoner listens for a while, then says, \u2018Yep. I know. I tried to escape myself, twenty years ago.\u2019 The young prisoner says, \u2018You did? Why didn't you tell me, all these months I was planning my escape? Why didn't you let me know it was impossible?\u2019 And the old prisoner shrugs, and says, \u2018So who publishes negative results?\u2019\u201d (Hudson, 1968, p. 168)",
