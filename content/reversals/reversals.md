## **Summary**

<br>

Replications of previous scientific work are at the core of the Open Scholarship movement. However, as replication efforts become more widespread, it can be challenging to scholars and educators to keep themselves up to date with which effects in their field replicate and which do not. FORRT’s replications and reversals aims to collate replications and specifically so-called reversal effects in social science. Reversals are—in the context of a replication—effects that have their original direction flipped. The extent of such reversals and non-replicated effects is already apparent in the social science literature, with even replicated effects being only half of the originally reported effect (Ioannidis, 2005; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Although such failures to replicate are far less costly to society than for example medical ones (Prasad & Cifu, 2011), they broadly hinder science's goal of accumulating knowledge and contribute to waste of scarce resources. This resource aims to be a “living”, freely available, crowd-sourced, and community-driven collection of effects that have either not been replicated or even reversed through empirical research across social sciences. Scholars from varied backgrounds and areas of social science are invited to contribute with prevalent effects in their respective fields.

<br>

## **Motivation**

The purpose of collating these reversal effects in social science is to encourage educators to incorporate replications of these effects into their students' project (e.g., third-year, thesis, course work) to provide them the opportunity to experience the research process directly, assess their ability to perform and report scientific research, and to help evaluate the robustness of the original study, thereby also helping them become good consumers of research. The below crowdsourced and community-curated resource aims to satisfy three of [FORRT’s Goals](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Support scholars in their efforts to learn and stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research;
* Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution;
* Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and its pedagogies.

and four of [FORRT’s Mission](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service;
* Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
* Building capacity for advocacy; and
* Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources.

<br>

## **Current Status**

This is a dynamic project that is organized in four stages. Currently, we are in stage 2: 

1. **~~Proof of Concept Phase (adaptation of original project into FORRT, inclusion of effects from social and cognitive psychology, using Gavin Leech’s collection as a basis) → ~150 entries finished in 2021.~~**

1. **Team Science Expansion Phase Across Disciplines** (crowd-sourcing entries and refine existing entries), started at the end of 2021 and planned until mid of 2023. Draft of first ‘output’ piece. Currently a total of 435+ effects documented, 380+ of those finished.

1. **Review Phase** (open review to identify inconsistencies, missing data, and errors), planned for the end of 2023. Finish first ‘output’ piece.

1. Regular **Update Phases** (dynamically adding new effects), planned for 2024 and beyond.

* **Spatial priming for emotional closeness**. Spatial distances cues were used as a prime for participants’ feelings regarding their emotional closeness to their families (Williams & Bargh, 2008). Participants were asked to plot points on a grid on a paper, either closer or further apart. Then they were asked to rate how emotionally close they feel towards their family members.

* **Social class on prosocial behaviour**. Individuals from a high social class are more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior than those from a low social class, but there is a U-shaped curve between social class and prosocial behavior that sometimes appears. The final study in the critique section below reported two pre-registered replications of Piff et al., 2010 with different results. There are more studies than those described here, but these should provide a good sense of the current state of the science.

* **Stanford Prison Experiment** employed a simulation of a prison environment to  examine the psychological effects of coercive situations. Utilizing role-playing, labeling and social expectations it showed that one third of participants in the role of prison guards displayed aggressive and dehumanizing behaviour.

* Status: NA
* Original paper: '[Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison](http://pdf.prisonexp.org/ijcp1973.pdf)', Haney, Banks, Zimbardo (1973)  [n=24, citations: [2115](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=9776461194085021745) (including highly referenced publications), (GS, January, 2022)].
* Critiques: First, the study has been criticized for the lack of adherence to the experimental methodology. Although the study has been widely described as an ‘experiment’ it lacks many defining features: 1) it does not define the precise set of manipulated variables, 2) it manipulates multiple variables at time without the proper control over the effects of each one, 3) it does not define the dependent variable and how it will be measured, 4) it does not state any clear hypotheses. It is noteworthy that in the original paper, authors present their work as a “demonstration” not an experiment. Second group of serious issues is the degree of researchers’ ad-hoc interventions that were influencing the behaviour of the participants. One of the leading researchers, Philip F. Zimbardo took part in the experimental procedure as the prisons’ “Superintendent”. Another close collaborator of the research team David Jaffe, who initially conceived the idea of the mock-prison study, was playing the role of the “Warden”. Considering that these people knew the goal of the study and were, as later admitted,  interested in the particular outcome (a call for reform of the prison system), the ad-hoc intervention, such as encouraging some of the guards to be more strict and ‘tough’, cast a reasonable doubt on the role of experimentator' expectations on the final results of the study. The third group of issues is sampling. Namely, the study has been conducted on a small (n=24, n per condition = 12) and largely unrepresentative sample (all males, all college students of similar age, all residents of the United States). Also, despite the screening procedures of the voluntarily applying candidates, it is still possible that a strong ‘demand characteristic’ and ‘self-selection bias’ may have affected the composition of the sample. All the participants have responded to the newspaper ad about wanting help in  “psychological study of prison life”. The last issue with the Stanford Prison Experiment is the interpretation of the results. Even if the discovered effect is trustworthy (and above mentioned issues put this into questions), there is no clear theoretical interpretation of what this finding actually proves. Some critics argue that violent behaviour of the guards may be rooted in their following of a strong leadership, rather than from their immersion into attributed social role.

* **Milgram experiment** was a study examining the influence of authority on the immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks of 15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock of 450 V.

Burger (n=70) also finds similar levels of compliance to Milgram, but the level didn't scale with the strength of the experimenter prods (see Table 5: the only real order among the prompts led to universal disobedience), so whatever was going on, it's not obedience. [One selection of follow-up studies](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.7724&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found average compliance of 63%, but suffer from the usual publication bias and tiny samples. (Selection was by a student of Milgram.) The most you can say is that there's weak evidence for compliance, rather than obedience. ("Milgram's interpretation of his findings has been largely rejected.").

* Critiques:  No good evidence that tribalism arises spontaneously following arbitrary groupings and scarcity, within weeks, and leads to inter-group violence. The “spontaneous” conflict among children at Robbers Cave was orchestrated by experimenters; tiny sample (maybe 70?); an exploratory study taken as inferential; no control group; there were really three experimental groups - that is, the experimenters had full power to set expectations and endorse deviance; results from their two other studies, with negative results, were not reported. Set aside the ethics: the total absence of consent - the boys and parents had no idea they were in an experiment - or the plan to set the forest on fire and leave the boys to it.

The effect has been interpreted by the author as evidence for the prevalence of independence (“_The preponderance of judgments was independent, evidence that under the present conditions the force of the perceived data far exceeded that of the majority._”, Asch, 1956, p.24). Nevertheless, the majority of academic textbooks present the study as evidence for overwhelming conformity, failing to report the evidence of independent tendencies among participants (see: Friend et al., 1990, Griggs, 2015). A common practice seen in many academic textbooks and popular writings is to report the value of “75%” or “76%” as the general indicator of conformity. In reality, this is the fraction of respondents who yielded to the majority in at least one of the twelve trials. The reversal of this value (rarely mentioned in the literature) would be 24% - a fraction of completely independent respondents or 95% - a fraction of respondents who remain independent in at least one of twelve trials.

* **Bilingual advantages in executive control**. The popular hypothesis was that speaking two languages also improves general cognitive control processes (executive control). However, this was challenged by a growing body of systematic studies, which showed no bilingual advantage across different executive control tasks, or even a small bilingual disadvantage. The lack of an effect was even found in exact replications of the original tasks, especially as sample size increases ([Paap et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2015.04.014)), and after accounting for the main moderators proposed by the bilingualism literature (Gunnerud et al., 2020).+

* **Risky Choice Framing Effect** (term used by Levin et al., 1998), alt-term = framing effect in risky-decision making. Under loss-frame, people are risk-seeking, whereas under gain-frame, people are risk-averse.

* **Above- and Below Average Effect**. Above-and-below-average effects arise when comparing oneself to others, whereby people rate themselves as above average for easy abilities and below average for difficult abilities. All standardized beta-values from multiple regression predicting judgmental weight of own and others’ abilities from mean comparative ability estimates in different ability domains were consistent with the original. Additionally, different statistical tests resulted in slightly smaller effects in the same direction of the original.

## **Marketing**

* **Choice overload**, the idea that giving people too many choices can lead to certain undesirable consequences such as reduced purchasing intentions, is in doubt, but most people don’t consider it to be discredited. 
{{< spoiler text="Statistics" >}}
* Status: Mixed (dueling meta-analyses, mix of successful and failed replications). It would probably require a systematic, multi-lab replication approach to sort this out at this point.
* Original study: [When choice is demotivating](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~ehv192/wiki.files/Choice_is_Demotivating%20Can%20one%20desire%20too%20much%20%20.pdf), Iyengar & Lepper, 2000. In the original field experiment with exotic jams where # flavors were manipulated (24 vs. 6), more stopped to browse the larger selection (60% vs 40%), but more purchased from the smaller selection (30% (31) vs. 3% (4)) (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). 3 experiments with n=249,193,. [citations=4897(GS,October 2021)].
* Failed replications: Scheibehenne (2008) failed to directly replicate Iyengar and Lepper (2000) jam study. Greifeneder (2008) did a lab experiment with chocolates and also failed to conceptually replicate. These replication failures are not definitive because there have been many studies (too many to list) in which the effect was (conceptually) replicated in some fashion.
* Meta-analyses: 
  * [Scheibehenne et al. 2010](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/37/3/409/1827647): “We found a mean effect size of virtually zero” (d=.02) [citations=1049(GS,October 2021)].
  * Chernev et al. 2010: That’s because many of the studies were designed to show instances when there is no effect. You need to split the data into “choice is good” vs. “choice is bad.”
  * Simonsohn et al. 2014: We agree with Chernev et al. (2010). When we split it up, we found that the choice is bad studies (choice overload) lack collective evidential value (uniform _p_-curve). 
  * Chernev et al. 2015: &lt;ignoring Simonsohn et al. 2014> Choice overload is a reliable effect under certain conditions (moderators).
* Original effect size: d=0.77 (study1) and d=0.29 (study2), and d=0.88 (study3) (as calculated from the X^2 values in the text with [this](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/mm/effectsizefaqs/calculator/calculator.html) online calculator)

Study 2: N=137; women in the mate guarding condition are asked to imagine they are at a party with their date and another woman is flirting with their date. The activation of a mate guarding motive increases women’s desire for conspicuous consumption. Study 3: N=115; replicates study 2 and shows that a mate guarding motive only increases desire for conspicuous goods. Study 4: N=75; the activation of a mate guarding motive increases women’s spending on luxurious accessories, but only when these accessories are visible to other women.

Showed some mixed evidence but mostly refuted claims. They found self-esteem was not related to smoking, alcohol, drug use; seemed to be only minimally associated with interpersonal success; Relationship with school performance seems to be that better school performance leads to higher self-esteem rather than the other way around. Self-esteem was moderately correlated with depression.

These indicate that clinicians with access to questionnaire data or life histories of patients use data from the Rorschach test, their predictive accuracy actually decreases, possibly because they place more weight on the Rorschach results which are lower quality than data from other sources.

* Note from a professor friend: the idea of a dual-mating hypothesis itself is not in trouble: the specific menstrual cycle research doesn't seem to replicate well. However, to my knowledge the basic pattern of short vs long term relationship goals predicting [women's] masculinity preferences is still robust.

Overall male effect was b = 0.17 and female effect was b = 0.11, with a nonsignificant difference between the two (p = 0.09). (They prefer to emphasise the lab studies over the online studies, which showed a stronger difference.)

* **Mindsets**, people’s beliefs about whether their talents and abilities are subject to growth and improvement. According to the meta-analysis by Sisk and colleagues ([2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617739704?casa_token=-RR4RSU-NewAAAAA%3ATpX_-Z-Y_hcn1MWoN7dWPJaW0YvOvLUYBwGk4Zq0fTt4FhtKewegFkV_Pr-2dDUG05NFLjLfY632)), the relationship between mindsets and academic achievement is weak: Of the 129 studies that they analyzed, only 37% found a positive relationship between mindset and academic outcomes. Furthermore, 58% of the studies found no relationship and 6% found a negative relationship between mindset and academic outcomes. Evidence on the efficacy of mindset interventions is not promising:  of the 29 studies reviewed, only 12% had a positive effect, 86% of the studies found no effect of the intervention and 2% found a negative effect of the intervention. It should be noted that interventions seemed to work for low SES populations.

## **Health Psychology**

* **Stress as the main/sole cause of peptic ulcers**. Until the 1980s, stress was believed to be the main cause of peptic ulcers (with secondary contributing factors thought to eb excess stomach acid, spicy food). There may be some effect/role of stress involved in development and/or healing of ulcers but the evidence shows it is not the primary cause as was previously believed.

* Subsequent researchers showed treating ulcers with antibiotics reduced recurrence by approx 90-95% (Gough et al. 1984 [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(84)91224-8/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(84)91224-8/fulltext) ). Stress/distress is still thought to be a contributing factor to development of ulcers (Levenstein et al. 1997; Levenstein et al. 1999; Overmeier & Murison 1997), as well as poorer response to treatment(Levenstein et al 1996), but is now recognised as not being the main or only influence.

Study 1: N= 603, shows that women are rated as less politically knowledgeable than men. Study 2: N=377; Female and male participants are randomly assigned to one of three conditions (stereotype not activated - control, stereotype activated by asking participants to report their gender, stereotype activated by a statement that there are gender differences in performance on the test participants are about to take) and answer a questionnaire assessing political knowledge.

## **Evolutionary Linguistics**

* **Typological Prevalence Hypothesis**. Claims that  cross-linguistically more prevalent distinctions are easier to learn, or the more common a certain distinction or way of categorizing across languages, the more cognitively natural (and easily learnable) for humans it should be. This effect is explored for the grammatical structure of evidentiality, or grammatical marking of information source in an utterance.
