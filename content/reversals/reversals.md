## **Summary**

<br>

Replications of previous scientific work are at the core of the Open Scholarship movement. However, as replication efforts become more widespread, it can be challenging to scholars and educators to keep themselves up to date with which effects in their field replicate and which do not. FORRT’s replications and reversals aims to collate replications and specifically so-called reversal effects in social science. Reversals are—in the context of a replication—effects that have their original direction flipped. The extent of such reversals and non-replicated effects is already apparent in the social science literature, with even replicated effects being only half of the originally reported effect (Ioannidis, 2005; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Although such failures to replicate are far less costly to society than for example medical ones (Prasad & Cifu, 2011), they broadly hinder science's goal of accumulating knowledge and contribute to waste of scarce resources. This resource aims to be a “living”, freely available, crowd-sourced, and community-driven collection of effects that have either not been replicated or even reversed through empirical research across social sciences. Scholars from varied backgrounds and areas of social science are invited to contribute with prevalent effects in their respective fields.

<br>

## **Motivation**

The purpose of collating these reversal effects in social science is to encourage educators to incorporate replications of these effects into their students' project (e.g., third-year, thesis, course work) to provide them the opportunity to experience the research process directly, assess their ability to perform and report scientific research, and to help evaluate the robustness of the original study, thereby also helping them become good consumers of research. The below crowdsourced and community-curated resource aims to satisfy three of [FORRT’s Goals](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Support scholars in their efforts to learn and stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research;
* Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution;
* Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and its pedagogies.

and four of [FORRT’s Mission](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service;
* Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
* Building capacity for advocacy; and
* Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources.

<br>

## **Current Status**

This is a dynamic project that is organized in four stages. Currently, we are in stage 2: 

1. **~~Proof of Concept Phase (adaptation of original project into FORRT, inclusion of effects from social and cognitive psychology, using Gavin Leech’s collection as a basis) → ~150 entries finished in 2021.~~**

1. **Team Science Expansion Phase Across Disciplines** (crowd-sourcing entries and refine existing entries), started at the end of 2021 and planned until the end of 2023. Drafting of first ‘output’ piece. Currently including a total of 470+ effects spanning 22 disciplines.

1. **Review Phase** (open review to identify inconsistencies, missing data, and errors), planned for 2024. Publishing of first ‘output’ piece.

1. Regular **Update Phases** (dynamically adding new effects), planned for 2025 and beyond.

You can find a list of all effects we are working on [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IY56xdDmoU9VasdE0sry2xvsGFkWPrqbKXAs1Rw-9LA/edit#gid=0). To search whether an effect already exists in our collection, use Ctrl-F or the search function together with a keyword in relation to the effect (e.g. "Macbeth" or "Priming"). Please note that not all effects in the spreadsheet are listed below, as this is a work in progress (last site update: 13th of July 2023)

* **Social class on prosocial behaviour**. Individuals from a high social class are more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior than those from a low social class, but there is a U-shaped curve between social class and prosocial behavior that sometimes appears. The final study in the critique section below reported two pre-registered replications of Piff et al., 2010 with different results. There are more studies than those described here, but these should provide a good sense of the current state of the science.

* Original effect size: Key claims were insinuation plus a battery of difference in means tests at up to 20% significance(!). _n_ = 24, data analysis on 21.
* Replication effect size: N/A. First, the study has been criticised for the lack of adherence to the experimental methodology. Although the study has been widely described as an ‘experiment’ it lacks many defining features: 1) it does not define the precise set of manipulated variables, 2) it manipulates multiple variables at time without the proper control over the effects of each one, 3) it does not define the dependent variable and how it will be measured, 4) it does not state any clear hypotheses. It is noteworthy that in the original paper, authors present their work as a “demonstration” not an experiment. Second group of serious issues is the degree of researchers’ ad-hoc interventions that were influencing the behaviour of the participants. One of the leading researchers, Philip F. Zimbardo took part in the experimental procedure as the prisons’ “Superintendent”. Another close collaborator of the research team David Jaffe, who initially conceived the idea of the mock-prison study, was playing the role of the “Warden”. Considering that these people knew the goal of the study and were, as later admitted,  interested in the particular outcome (a call for reform of the prison system), the ad-hoc intervention, such as encouraging some of the guards to be more strict and ‘tough’, cast a reasonable doubt on the role of experimentator' expectations on the final results of the study. The third group of issues is sampling. Namely, the study has been conducted on a small (n=24, n per condition = 12) and largely unrepresentative sample (all males, all college students of similar age, all residents of the United States). Also, despite the screening procedures of the voluntarily applying candidates, it is still possible that a strong ‘demand characteristic’ and ‘self-selection bias’ may have affected the composition of the sample. All the participants have responded to the newspaper ad about wanting help in  “psychological study of prison life”. The last issue with the Stanford Prison Experiment is the interpretation of the results. Even if the discovered effect is trustworthy (and above mentioned issues put this into questions), there is no clear theoretical interpretation of what this finding actually proves. Some critics argue that violent behaviour of the guards may be rooted in their following of a strong leadership, rather than from their immersion into attributed social role.

* **Milgram experiment** was a study examining the influence of authority on the immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks of 15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock of 450 V.

Doliński et al.: comparable effects to Milgram. Burger: similar levels of compliance to Milgram, but the level didn't scale with the strength of the experimenter prods. Blass: average compliance of 63%, but suffer from the usual publication bias and tiny samples. (Selection was by a student of Milgram.)

Various sources (Billig, Perry, Tavris): No good evidence that tribalism arises spontaneously following arbitrary groupings and scarcity, within weeks, and leads to inter-group violence. The “spontaneous” conflict among children at Robbers Cave was orchestrated by experimenters; tiny sample (maybe 70?); an exploratory study taken as inferential; no control group; there were really three experimental groups - that is, the experimenters had full power to set expectations and endorse deviance; results from their two other studies, with negative results, were not reported. Set aside the ethics: the total absence of consent - the boys and parents had no idea they were in an experiment - or the plan to set the forest on fire and leave the boys to it.

* Original effect size: 36.8% of the responses were incorrect (influenced by the majority). The effect has been interpreted by the author as evidence for the prevalence of independence (“_The preponderance of judgments was independent, evidence that under the present conditions the force of the perceived data far exceeded that of the majority._”, Asch, 1956, p.24). 
* Replication effect size: Bond and Smith: _d_ = .92[.89-.96], average rate of incorrect answers: 25%. Friend et al./Griggs: The majority of academic textbooks present the study as evidence for overwhelming conformity, failing to report the evidence of independent tendencies among participants. A common practice seen in many academic textbooks and popular writings is to report the value of “75%” or “76%” as the general indicator of conformity. In reality, this is the fraction of respondents who yielded to the majority in at least one of the twelve trials. The reversal of this value (rarely mentioned in the literature) would be 24% - a fraction of completely independent respondents or 95% - a fraction of respondents who remain independent in at least one of twelve trials.

* **Unethicality darkens perception of light** (El Greco fallacy). Recalling abstract concepts such as evil (as exemplified by unethical deeds) and goodness (as exemplified by ethical deeds) can influence the sensory experience of the brightness of light. Recalling unethical behaviour led participants to see the room as darker and to desire more light-emitting products (e.g., a flashlight) compared to recalling ethical behaviour.

* **Personal cognitive dissonance - free-choice paradigm**. Personal cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), suggests that an inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., an attitude and a past behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., personal dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This personal cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following three main ones: free-choice, induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. The mere act of choosing equally desirable options can arouse dissonance in the individual, because choosing option A implies the rejection of option B (in other words, choosing option A means accepting its advantages but also its disadvantages, but also accepting to deprive oneself of the advantages of option B). In order to reduce dissonance, subjects will increase the perceived gap between options (i.e., spreading of alternatives) by overestimating the chosen option and/or underestimating the rejected option. ​

* **Personal cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, dissonance is aroused by making individuals aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​

* **Vicarious cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm**. Vicarious cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; see “personal cognitive dissonance”), suggests that it would be possible for an individual to experience dissonance _vicariously_ when they witness the performance of inconsistent act (e.g., counter-attitudinal or counter-normative behaviour) on the part of an in-group member with whom they strongly identify. As a personal cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., between attitude and observed behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., vicarious dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This vicarious cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following two main ones: induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. In this paradigm, subjects are led to observe the realisation, by a member of their in-group, of a counter-attitudinal act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act), performed in a context of free choice. Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, etc.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​

* **Vicarious cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, subjects are made to observe a member of their group becoming aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​

* **Ability EI as a factor of intelligence**. Ability EI is a collection of cognitive abilities relating to the recognition, understanding and management of emotions. There have been many controversies in attempting to contextualise Ability EI within models of intelligence/cognitive ability. MacCann et al. (2014) empirically tested multiple models of how various cognitive abilities interact, including hierarchical and bi-factor models, and the data demonstrated closest fit to a hierarchical structure where Ability EI was contextualised as a second-stratum factor. A recent replication repeated this modelling process and drew the same conclusion.

* **Age of acquisition influences the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (progressive demasking)**. Early-acquired items are identified more accurately than late-acquired items, using a progressive demasking task. A progressive demasking task is a type of perceptual identification task where participants are presented with a series of words that are gradually revealed over time and their ability to identify words at each stage of the task is measured. Words learned at an earlier age are thought to be easier to demask than those learned later in life, perhaps because the individual has gained more experience and exposure to the word, which can make it easier to recognize.

* **Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (anagram solution)**. Age of acquisition is thought to affect lexical retrieval through its impact on anagram (word jumbles) solutions, such that words acquired at an earlier age tend to be solved more quickly and accurately in anagram tasks than those learned later in life. This may be because words learned earlier in life are more deeply encoded and may therefore be more easily accessed.

* **Age of acquisition influence on the post-lexical stages of lexical retrieval** (delayed spoken picture naming). Early-acquired words should not differ from late-acquired words in terms of accuracy and response speed of spoken naming, when using a delayed picture naming task that requires participants to name a picture a few seconds (e.g. 2-4 sec) after seeing the actual picture. This task enables researchers to assess if any possible delay of naming effects result at an articulatory level, as opposed to a conceptual level or lexical retrieval stage.

* **Age of acquisition influence on speeded phonological retrieval** (transparent language). Early-acquired words are responded to more quickly and accurately than late-acquired words, using a speeded naming paradigm, where participants must name the items as quickly as possible within a short timeframe (e.g. 400 milliseconds). This effect is argued to reduce the influence of semantics on phonological activation, which is argued to accumulate over the word naming process.

The lack of an effect was even found in exact replications of the original tasks, especially as sample size increases ([Paap et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2015.04.014)), and after accounting for the main moderators proposed by the bilingualism literature (Gunnerud et al., 2020).+

* **Risky Choice Framing Effect** (term used by Levin et al., 1998), alt-term = framing effect in risky-decision making. Under loss-frame, people are risk-seeking, whereas under gain-frame, people are risk-averse. In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are differently described and the resulting preferences are studied ([Kühberger, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1998.2781)). In risky choice problems, the way a choice is presented influences the decision. (e.g. saving 10 people out of 100 vs losing 90 people out of 100).

* **Above- and Below Average Effect**. Above-and-below-average effects arise when comparing oneself to others, whereby people rate themselves as above average for easy abilities and below average for difficult abilities. All standardized beta-values from multiple regression predicting judgmental weight of own and others’ abilities from mean comparative ability estimates in different ability domains were consistent with the original. Additionally, different statistical tests resulted in slightly smaller effects in the same direction of the original.

## **Marketing**

* **Choice overload**, the idea that giving people too many choices can lead to certain undesirable consequences such as reduced purchasing intentions, is in doubt, but most people don’t consider it to be discredited. 
{{< spoiler text="Statistics" >}}
* Status: Mixed (dueling meta-analyses, mix of successful and failed replications). It would probably require a systematic, multi-lab replication approach to sort this out at this point.
* Original study: [When choice is demotivating](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~ehv192/wiki.files/Choice_is_Demotivating%20Can%20one%20desire%20too%20much%20%20.pdf), Iyengar & Lepper, 2000. In the original field experiment with exotic jams where # flavors were manipulated (24 vs. 6), more stopped to browse the larger selection (60% vs 40%), but more purchased from the smaller selection (30% (31) vs. 3% (4)) (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). 3 experiments with n=249,193,. [citations=4897(GS,October 2021)].
* Failed replications: Scheibehenne (2008) failed to directly replicate Iyengar and Lepper (2000) jam study. Greifeneder (2008) did a lab experiment with chocolates and also failed to conceptually replicate. These replication failures are not definitive because there have been many studies (too many to list) in which the effect was (conceptually) replicated in some fashion.
* Meta-analyses: 
  * [Scheibehenne et al. 2010](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/37/3/409/1827647): “We found a mean effect size of virtually zero” (d=.02) [citations=1049(GS,October 2021)].
  * Chernev et al. 2010: That’s because many of the studies were designed to show instances when there is no effect. You need to split the data into “choice is good” vs. “choice is bad.”
  * Simonsohn et al. 2014: We agree with Chernev et al. (2010). When we split it up, we found that the choice is bad studies (choice overload) lack collective evidential value (uniform _p_-curve). 
  * Chernev et al. 2015: &lt;ignoring Simonsohn et al. 2014> Choice overload is a reliable effect under certain conditions (moderators).
* Original effect size: d=0.77 (study1) and d=0.29 (study2), and d=0.88 (study3) (as calculated from the X^2 values in the text with [this](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/mm/effectsizefaqs/calculator/calculator.html) online calculator)

Showed some mixed evidence but mostly refuted claims. They found self-esteem was not related to smoking, alcohol, drug use; seemed to be only minimally associated with interpersonal success; Relationship with school performance seems to be that better school performance leads to higher self-esteem rather than the other way around. Self-esteem was moderately correlated with depression.

Overall male effect was b = 0.17 and female effect was b = 0.11, with a nonsignificant difference between the two (p = 0.09). (They prefer to emphasise the lab studies over the online studies, which showed a stronger difference.)

* **Mindsets**, people’s beliefs about whether their talents and abilities are subject to growth and improvement. According to the meta-analysis by Sisk and colleagues ([2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617739704?casa_token=-RR4RSU-NewAAAAA%3ATpX_-Z-Y_hcn1MWoN7dWPJaW0YvOvLUYBwGk4Zq0fTt4FhtKewegFkV_Pr-2dDUG05NFLjLfY632)), the relationship between mindsets and academic achievement is weak: Of the 129 studies that they analyzed, only 37% found a positive relationship between mindset and academic outcomes. Furthermore, 58% of the studies found no relationship and 6% found a negative relationship between mindset and academic outcomes. Evidence on the efficacy of mindset interventions is not promising:  of the 29 studies reviewed, only 12% had a positive effect, 86% of the studies found no effect of the intervention and 2% found a negative effect of the intervention. It should be noted that interventions seemed to work for low SES populations.

## **Health Psychology**

* **Stress as the main/sole cause of peptic ulcers**. Until the 1980s, stress was believed to be the main cause of peptic ulcers (with secondary contributing factors thought to eb excess stomach acid, spicy food). There may be some effect/role of stress involved in development and/or healing of ulcers but the evidence shows it is not the primary cause as was previously believed.

* Subsequent researchers showed treating ulcers with antibiotics reduced recurrence by approx 90-95% (Gough et al. 1984 [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(84)91224-8/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(84)91224-8/fulltext) ). Stress/distress is still thought to be a contributing factor to development of ulcers (Levenstein et al. 1997; Levenstein et al. 1999; Overmeier & Murison 1997), as well as poorer response to treatment(Levenstein et al 1996), but is now recognised as not being the main or only influence.

## **Evolutionary Linguistics**

* **Typological Prevalence Hypothesis**. Claims that  cross-linguistically more prevalent distinctions are easier to learn, or the more common a certain distinction or way of categorizing across languages, the more cognitively natural (and easily learnable) for humans it should be. This effect is explored for the grammatical structure of evidentiality, or grammatical marking of information source in an utterance.
