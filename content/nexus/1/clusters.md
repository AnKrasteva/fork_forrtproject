The nexus elements will be indexed according to seven clusters pervading open and reproducible literature.

1. reproducibility and replicability knowledge 
2. conceptual and statistical knowledge 
3. reproducible analyses 
4. preregistration 
5. FAIR data and materials  
6. replication research
7. academic life and culture

FORRT further specifies its components as a means to draw fuzzy boundaries between clusters while allowing for diversification and heterogeneity in how each chooses to integrate these sub-clusters with field content. The breakdown of each cluster into sub-categories provides scholars with useful information on the extant of open science scholarship, and how they are connected to one another.
