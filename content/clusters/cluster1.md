  <b>Reproducibility and replicability knowledge:</b> Attainment of a grounding in the motivations and theoretical underpinnings of reproducible and open research. Integration with field specific content (i.e., or grounded in the history of replicability).
  
  i. Reproducibility crisis and credibility revolution.
  
  ii. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses.
  
  iii. Questionable research practices (its ‘theory’), and prevalence.
  
  iv. Proposed improvement science initiatives on statistics, measurement, teaching, data sharing, code sharing, pre-registration, replication.
  
  v. Ongoing debates, (e.g. incentives for and against open science).
  
  vi. Ethical considerations for improved practices.

  <b>Conceptual and Statistical Knowledge:</b> Enacting this principle indicates that students attain a grounding in fundamental statistics, measurement, and its implications.
  
  i. The logic of null hypothesis testing, p-values, Type I and II errors (and when and why they might happen).

  ii. Limitations and benefits of NHST, Bayesian and Likelihood approaches.
  
  iii. Effect sizes, Statistical power, Confidence Intervals.

  iv. Research Design, Sample Methods, and its implications for inferences.

  v. Questionable research (QRPs) & measurement practices (QMPs).

  i. Purpose of preregistration - distinguishing exploratory and confirmatory analyses, transparency measures
  
  ii. Preregistration and registered reports - strengths and differences
  
  iii. When can you preregister? Can you pre-register secondary data?

  iv. Writing a preregistration.

  v. Comparing a preregistration to a final study manuscript.
