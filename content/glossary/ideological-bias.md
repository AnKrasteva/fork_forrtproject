    "title": "Ideological  bias",
    "definition": "Pre-existing opinions about the quality of research dependent on the ideology of the author. Favourable opinions towards the research are more likely if friends, collaborators, or scientists agree with an editor or reviewer’s opinion (Tvina et al. 2019). This can lead to a variety of conflicts of interest that undermine diverse perspectives, for example; speeding or delaying peer-review, or influencing the chances of an individual being invited to present their research, thus promoting their work.",
