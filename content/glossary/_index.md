This is a working in progress version of the Glossary which is (probably) filled with mistakes. This uses an older, non-reviewed version of the Glosssary. We are trying to see what is the best way to show information and terms.

We successfully arrived at the last stage of Phase 1 ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³. This means we managed to go from an ambitious idea to a full blown crowdsourced project in which more than 110 collaborators defined and reviewed almost 300 Open Scholarship terms.

The list of terms we have drafted and reviewed can be found on the left if you are viewing this page on a computer screen or bigger, otherwise they can be found at the bottom of the page. If you hover a word, you will be able to read the full description of the term. To know more about a term, including references, simply click on it and it will bring you to the term page.

Each term is based on a standard template. Here is an example:

## CRediT

**Definition:**  The Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT; https://casrai.org/credit/) is a high-level taxonomy, including 14 roles, that can be used to indicate the roles typically adopted by contributors to scientific scholarly output. The roles describe each contributorâ€™s specific contribution to the scholarly output. They can be assigned multiple times to different authors and one author can also be assigned multiple roles. CRediT includes the following roles: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal Analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â€“ original draft, Writing â€“ review & editing. A description of the different roles can be found in the work of Brand et al., (2015).
