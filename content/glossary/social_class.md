    "definition": "Social class is usually measured using both objective and subjective measurements, as recommended by the American Psychological Association (Saegert et al., 2007). Unlike the conventional concept, which only considers one factor, either education or income (e.g., economic variables), an individual's social class is considered to be a combination of their  education, income, occupational prestige, subjective social status, and self-identified social class.  Social class is partly a cultural variable, as it is a stable variable and likely to change slowly over the years, while it is an economic variable, in which there is potential to change more quickly as a result of the individual’s current income and assets.  An individual may have a high socio-economic status yet identify as a working class individual. Working class students come to university at different times in their lives and have different, often more restrictive commitments. Also, working class students are less satisfied with their finance, leading to less social integration (Rubin, 2021). The lack of time and money is obstructive to their social experience at university and working class students are more likely to work to support themselves, resulting in less time for them to socialise with other students and less money to purchase items linked to social experiences (e.g. food).",
