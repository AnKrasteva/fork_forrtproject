# FORRT's Manuscripts

<br>

FORRT’s community has written (and is writing) various manuscripts on its several initiatiaves. 

team wrote a manuscript explaining why open and reproducible tenets should be incorporated in the teaching and mentoring of prototypical subject matters.  In line with principles enshrined in FORRT, this manuscript is an open online contributorship project. The work of all contributors are valued and will be formally recognized. With this, we hope to expand the scope and diversity of FORRT’s mission and its team."


FORRT's e-learning platform (or Nexus) is a hub for community-driven initiatives and resources. Teachers’ and researchers’ time constraints are substantial, posing a challenge to developing course materials and integrating new research practices in teaching. This challenge motivated FORRT to develop strategies and propose solutions to mitigate time constraints and help scholars implement open and principled education in their workflows. The focus of FORRT's Educational Nexus lies not on simply aggregating resources but on making sense of existing materials and ideas, giving them context and continuity, as well as filling in the gap where no connections exist.
