title: "Introducing Nowhere Lab"
subtitle: "One year on."
summary: "This piece summarises research and data lessons I learnt one year into my first non-academic job. After seven years in academia, I felt that my development had stalled, I was no longer feeling excited about continuing my career in academia, and I was keen to explore new pathways. One year on, I have so many reflections I want to share. Spoiler alert: My inner nerd is very happy."
