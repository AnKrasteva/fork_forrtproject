**_130 Summaries+ of Open and Reproducible Literature_**

[Download our PDF](OS_Literature_Summaries_by_FORRT.pdf)

**Purpose**

The purpose of these summaries is to reduce some of the burden on educators looking to incorporate open and reproducible research principles into their teaching. The below crowdsourced and community-curated resource aims to satisfy three of [FORRT’s Goals](https://forrt.org/about/mission/): 



*   Support scholars in their efforts to learn and stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research;
*   Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution;
*   Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and its pedagogies.

and four of [FORRT’s Mission](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):



*   Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service;
*   Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
*   Building capacity for advocacy; and
*   Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources.

**What is FORRT?**

FORRT stands for Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training and is designed by, and envisioned for, educators who wish to integrate typical discipline content with open and reproducible science tenets. We are a community, 50 people strong and growing, that aims to provide a pedagogical infrastructure designed to recognize and support the teaching and mentoring of open and reproducible science. FORRT strives to be an effective, evolving, and community-driven organization raising awareness of the pedagogical implications of open and reproducible science and its associated challenges (i.e., curricular reform, epistemological uncertainty, methods of education). FORRT advocates for the opening of teaching and mentoring materials as a means to facilitate access, discovery, and learning to those who otherwise would be educationally disenfranchised. FORRT created a three-pronged approach to achieve its goals:



1. Providing educators a comprehensive, straightforward, and accessible framework to qualify and quantify the degree of open and reproducible research practices in their teaching and mentoring (cf. FORRT’s Clusters at [FORRT’s Manuscript](https://forrt.org/manuscript/)). Also, through [FORRT’s self-assessment tool](https://forrt.org/self-assessment/), educators are supplied with a personalized pathway toward incremental integration of discipline content with open and reproducible science tenets. FORRT also curates and documents a collection of 700 resources on Open and Reproducible Science (_cf._ [FORRT database](https://forrt.org/resources/)).
2. Equipping scholars with high quality pedagogical tools on open and reproducible research practices (e.g., this resource, but also other ongoing initiatives). Instructors can then adapt successful and implemented pedagogies to help ease the transition and reduce the instructor’s burden. \
[FORRT’s Pedagogies](https://forrt.org/pedagogies/) (in development)
3. Modifying the academic incentive structure regarding teaching and mentoring through recognition and commendations of excellent teaching and mentoring, which in turn are documentable and relevant to the researchers’ visibility, prestige, tenure and promotion reviews; foster social justice through the opening and democratization of scientific-educational resources to those who otherwise would be educationally disenfranchised; and building a community with existing educational initiatives and strengthening our missions, identify and reduce redundancies, and streamline the advancement of open educational practices. \

**Process & Credit**

Any and all contributions are formally recognized here. In large part, these summaries are the product of Mahmoud Elsherif, a cherished member of FORRT community, who bore the brunt of most of the work. Flavio Azevedo conceptualized the project, managed it, checked and reviewed summaries. The FORRT community and CSCCE community has further reviewed this work, edited, commented, and enriched it. This is truly a community effort in the name of supporting scholars in their efforts to learn, stay up-to-date and teach open and reproducible science in Higher Education.

**Future plans**

We at FORRT hope to continue curating and expanding these summaries. We aim to classify the summaries into useful and didactic categories. We are keen on broadening the scope of these summaries towards an often neglected topic in open and reproducible science, that of social injustices and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) in academia, which is in line with feedback received from CSCCE community, as well as expanding list beyond gender and race (also social class, economic status), and making the methodology used more transparent, which should help crowdsourcing the database (e.g., consider a systematic review like-approach). We also aim to further integrate this initiative with other FORRT initiatives, namely, making sure that all open and reproducible sources cited in the [FORRT’s Manuscript](https://forrt.org/manuscript/) have an associated summary to facilitate the reading of FORRT’s manifesto. The same goes for the [FORRT’s self-assessment tool](https://forrt.org/self-assessment/) where educators evaluate their teaching and/or mentoring --i.e., the extent to which their teaching abides by open and reproducible research practices-- and they receive feedback (on topics they requested), we hope to provide summaries for each of the personalized recommendations. We also hope to include every summary as a resource in [FORRT’s curated list of resources](https://forrt.org/resources/), as well include FORRT Clusters’ tags for each summary. 

Lastly, we are considering formalizing this initiative with the drafting of a manuscript, summarizing lessons we learned and hopefully making it a more useful resource to the community. As of now, we are thinking of integrating FORRT’s 7 Clusters (e.g., reproducibility and replicability knowledge, conceptual and statistical knowledge, reproducible analyses, Preregistration, FAIR data and materials, replication research, academic life and culture) with these summaries.
