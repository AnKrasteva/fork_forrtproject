# *100+ Summaries of Open and Reproducible Science Literature*

## Overview

The FORRT community has prepared 100+ summaries of Open and Reproducible Science literature. The purpose of these summaries is to reduce some of the burden on educators looking to incorporate open and reproducible research principles into their teaching as well as facilitate the edification of anyone wishing to learn or disseminate open and reproducible science tenets.

***These summaries are very much a work in progress***. We would love to receive your [criticism, areas for improvement, ideas, and help](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W12WpzI70Ja1FiVeflXNW8VFPzqFFvu_mL2YkNQ_cHk/edit?usp=sharing). 

You can find the summaries via the menu in the left. We made a distinction between "[Open and Reproducible Science](/summaries/open-reproducible/)" summaries, and "[Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion](/diversity-equity-inclusion/)" summaries to facilitate searching. We have also prepared a [.pdf version of these summaries](OS_Literature_Summaries_by_FORRT.pdf) in case you want to keep a copy for yourself. If you are an educator you may also be interested in our [FORRT Open and Reproducible Science Syllabus](FORRT_O&R_101_Syllabus.pdf)

### Purpose

The purpose of these summaries is to reduce some of the burden on educators looking to incorporate open and reproducible research principles into their teaching as well as facilitate the edification of anyone wishing to learn or disseminate open and reproducible science tenets.

 The below crowdsourced and community-curated resource aims to satisfy three of [FORRT’s Goals](about/mission/): 
*   Support scholars in their efforts to learn and stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research;
*   Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution;
*   Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and its pedagogies.

and four of [FORRT’s Mission](/about/mission/):

*   Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service;
*   Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
*   Building capacity for advocacy; and
*   Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources.

### Future plans

We at FORRT hope to continue curating and expanding these summaries. We aim to classify the summaries into useful and didactic categories. We are keen on broadening the scope of these summaries toward often neglected topics in open and reproducible science: that of social injustices and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) in academia

 and making the methodology used more transparent, which should help crowdsourcing the database (e.g., consider a systematic review like-approach). We also aim to further integrate this initiative with other FORRT initiatives, namely, making sure that all open and reproducible sources cited in the [FORRT’s Manuscript](https://forrt.org/manuscript/) have an associated summary to facilitate the reading of FORRT’s manifesto. The same goes for the [FORRT’s self-assessment tool](https://forrt.org/self-assessment/) where educators evaluate their teaching and/or mentoring --i.e., the extent to which their teaching abides by open and reproducible research practices-- and they receive feedback (on topics they requested), we hope to provide summaries for each of the personalized recommendations. We also hope to include every summary as a resource in [FORRT’s curated list of resources](https://forrt.org/resources/), as well include FORRT Clusters’ tags for each summary. 

Lastly, we are considering formalizing this initiative with the drafting of a manuscript, summarizing lessons we learned and hopefully making it a more useful resource to the community. As of now, we are thinking of integrating FORRT’s 7 Clusters (e.g., reproducibility and replicability knowledge, conceptual and statistical knowledge, reproducible analyses, Preregistration, FAIR data and materials, replication research, academic life and culture) with these summaries.

Ideas are for example to make a hackaton to make these summaries better. We would like OS organizations like (___ list them, and others) to help us in this process.

### Process & Credit

Any and all contributions in FORRT are formally recognized. In large part, these summaries are a result of the heroic work of Mahmoud Elsherif, a cherished member of FORRT community, who bore the brunt of most of the initial work. Flavio Azevedo conceptualized the project, managed the initiative and reviewed the majority of the summaries. This project would not have been possible with Leticia Micheli, Martin Vasilev, Jacob Miranda, Tamara Marques, Esther Plomp, and Catia Oliveira who revised and improved the summaries to its final stage. Furthermore, the FORRT community and [CSCCE community](https://www.cscce.org/) which has done a fair bit of reviewing of the DEI summaries. Thank you for editeding, commenting, and enriching it. This is truly a community effort in the name of supporting scholars in their efforts to learn, stay up-to-date and teach open and reproducible science in Higher Education.
