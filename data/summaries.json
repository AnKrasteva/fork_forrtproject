We surveyed 1,292 psychologists to address two questions: Do psychologists support these concrete changes to data collection, reporting, and publication practices, and if not, what are their reasons? Respondents also indicated the percentage of print and online journal space that should be dedicated to novel studies and direct replications as well as the percentage of published psychological research that they believed would be confirmed if direct replications were conducted. We found that psychologists are generally open to change. Five requirements for researchers and three guidelines for reviewers were supported as standards of good practice, whereas one requirement was even supported as a publication condition.

There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors.

In science, consumers of new scientific findings must likewise evaluate the strength of the findings and decide their willingness to put stock in them. In both kinds of markets, the inability to make informed and accurate evaluations of quality (i.e., quality uncertainty) leads to a lower and lower willingness to put stock in any product \u2013 a lack of trust in the market itself.

Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encouraging authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars \u2013 they cannot reliably tell the difference between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon \u2013 quality uncertainty \u2013 has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals\u2019 reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts.

These criteria aim to ensure that a theory is constrained by all of our existing knowledge (existing observations and other good theories), without the benefit of flexibility to tailor the explanation to any possible pattern of observation. In other words, the conjectures that comprise a theory must be inflexible while still allowing the theory to account for its explicanda. This property of good theories constrains the way in which that theory can be changed. A good theory will resist most changes, because the explanation for any change must be consistent with the retained inflexible conjectures of that theory without making the theory inconsistent with existing observations.\u201d (p.4).", "Abstract": "Science progresses by finding and correcting problems in theories.

Based on contemporary philosophy of science, we argue that good theories are hard-to-vary: they (1) explain what they are supposed to explain, (2) are consistent with other good theories, and (3) cannot easily be adapted to explain anything. Theories can be improved by identifying problems in them either by argument or by experimental test, and then correcting these problems by changing the theory. Importantly, such changes and the resultant theory should only be assessed based on whether they are hard-to-vary. An assessment of the current state of the behavioral sciences reveals that theory development is arrested by the lack of consideration for how easy it is to change theories to account for unexpected observations. Further, most of the current method-oriented solutions are unlikely to contribute much to the development of good theories, because they do not work towards eliminating this problem. Instead, they reward only temporary inflexibility in theories, and promote the assessment of theory change based on whether the theory was changed before (confirmatory) or after (exploratory) an experimental test, but not whether that change yields a hard-to-vary theory.

It also calculates the number of additional studies to reduce an observed mean effect size to a desired minimal effect size.", "However, these approaches have several problems: \u201cThe first is that they are both explicitly unweighted. One of the primary attributes of contemporary meta-analysis is weighting; studies with large sample size or small variance are given higher weight than those with small sample sizes or large variance. Neither method accounts for the weight of the observed or the hypothesized unpublished studies. A second problem with Rosenthal\u2019s method is that the method of adding Z-scores is not normally the method by which one combines studies in a meta-analysis; most modern meta-analyses are based on the combination of effect sizes, not simply significance values (Rosenberg et al. 2000). Rosenthal\u2019s calculation is therefore not precisely applicable to the actual significance obtained from a meta-analysis. Orwin\u2019s method is not based on significance testing; the choice of a desired minimal effect size to test the observed mean against seems unstable without a corresponding measure of variance\u201d (pp.464-465).", "The article proposes a general, weighted fail-safe calculation framework applicable to both fixed- and random-effects models.", "The original fail-safe calculations are based on the fixed-effect model, but the authors estimate a fail-safe number for random-effects model meta-analysis.", "Although the number of studies of null effect are perceived as important to change a significant outcome in the fixed-effect calculations, these studies for the random-effects model involve a sum-of-squares calculation that we need to assume have effects that are precisely zero. This assumption could be partially avoided by simulating missing studies with a desired variance."], "Quote": "\u201cOne needs to remember that a fail-safe calculation is neither a method of identifying publication bias nor a method of accounting for publication bias that does exist. It is simply a procedure by which one can estimate whether publication biases (if they exist) may be safely ignored...While perhaps not as elegant as some of these methods, a fail-safe number is much simpler to calculate. Hopefully, the approach presented here will allow us to better estimate the potential for unpublished or missing studies to alter our conclusions; a low fail-safe number should certainly encourage researchers to pursue the more complicated publication bias methodologies.\u201d (p.467).", "Abstract": "Quantitative literature reviews such as meta-analysis are becoming common in evolutionary biology but may be strongly affected by publication biases. Using fail-safe numbers is a quick way to estimate whether publication bias is likely to be a problem for a specific study.

In a bibliometric investigation covering a broad range of social sciences, we analyzed published articles on gender bias and race bias and established that articles on gender bias are funded less often and published in journals with a lower Impact Factor than articles on comparable instances of social discrimination. This result suggests the possibility of an underappreciation of the phenomenon of gender bias and related research within the academic community.

Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions. The present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including Quote\u00a0from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel \u2018registered report\u2019 formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known. The recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of \u201cfuture-proofing\u201d meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed.

Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to faculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer science, and the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205 Phd.-granting\u00a0departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and on the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and does facilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a mechanism, we then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models to simulate the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of where an idea originates on its long-term diffusion across the network. We find that research from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of similar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses establish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the quality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation.

These decisions are often made quickly, sometimes without much thought, and sometimes without awareness that a decision has been made. Being open has changed our awareness of these little decisions. Lab members bring them to the forefront early in the research process where they may be critically examined. One example is that a student brought up outlier detection very early in the process knowing that not only would she have to report her approach, but that others could try different approaches with the same data.

Are there differences compared with articles published in journals with a somewhat lower impact factor that have adopted editorial policies to reduce the impact of limitations of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing? To investigate these questions, the current study analyzed all articles related to psychological, neuropsychological and medical issues, published in 2011 in four journals with high impact factors: Science, Nature, The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet, and three journals with relatively lower impact factors: Neuropsychology, Journal of Experimental Psychology-Applied and the American Journal of Public Health. Results show that Null Hypothesis Significance Testing without any use of confidence intervals, effect size, prospective power and model estimation, is the prevalent statistical practice used in articles published in Nature, 89%, followed by articles published in Science, 42%. By contrast, in all other journals, both with high and lower impact factors, most articles report confidence intervals and/or effect size measures.

In today\u2019s academic world, a meritorious scholar is one who publishes high quality work that is frequently cited, who receives plentiful funding and scientific awards, and who is well regarded among his or her peers. In other words, merit is defined by how successful the scholar has been in terms of promoting his or her own career. In this commentary, I argue that there has been an overemphasis on measuring individual career outcomes and that we should be more concerned with the effect that scholars have on the scientific system in which they are embedded. Put simply, the question we should be asking is whether and to what extent a scholar has advanced the scientific discipline and moved the field forward collectively.", "Reference": "Pickett, C.

Scientific institutions and gatekeepers should be a bulwark against the corrupting influence of the drive for eminence, and help researchers maintain integrity and uphold scientific values in the face of internal and external pressures to compromise. One implication for evaluating scientific merit is that gatekeepers should attempt to reward all scientists whose work reaches a more objective threshold of scientific rigor or soundness, rather than attempting to select the cream of the crop (i.e., identify the most \u201ceminent\u201d).", "Reference": "Vazire, S.

This indicator is perceived as more reliable than early career award, as an early career award is founded on a much smaller and likely less representative sample of that career. \u00a0This limitation also applies to an award for a single publication such as best article recognition, as it may not predict the citations that the article later receives in the literature. The article argues that it makes most sense to concentrate on assessing lifetime contributions to psychological science.", "Another measure to assess scientific achievement is an invitation to write a definitive handbook chapter, as it indicates that the scientist is a widely recognised expert on this specific topic.", "A final measure to indicate that a scientist is well known is the simple count of total citations. However, this may be assessed by several alternative citation measures (e.g. h-index and i10).", "However, these measures suffer from poor predictive validity, as the relationship between various predictors and criterion variables tend to be small to moderate, not large enough to make fine discriminations among scientists. In turn, these predictive utilities are contaminated with other potentially biasing factors (e.g. gender, ethnicity, specialty, methodology, ideology, affiliation, and publication type).", "In addition, these measures suffer from interjudge reliability, as a psychologist receives mixed reviews after submitting a manuscript to a high-impact journal. For instance, one referee recommends the author to publish the manuscript with minor revision, while another advises an outright rejection. This frustrates the author and the editor, but proves the discipline lacks a strong consensus on what contributes to science or their specific area.", "This lack of agreement should be reduced if evaluators operate with a larger sample of contributions such as lifetime career awards. However, the same problem from interjudge reliability applies to lifetime awards, as one committee member would argue that the scientist deserves this award, while a minority of the committee may disagree with the final decision and argue another scientist deserves this award.

This expectation would be especially strong given that scientists purport to make inferences based on empirical fact and logical reasoning. Not only would peer assessments prove highly objective, but scientists\u2019 self-assessments of their own contributions should depart relatively little from colleagues in the best position to evaluate their work. In short, a strong consensus should permeate all evaluations. One specific manifestation of this consensus would appear in the awards and honors bestowed on those scientists who have devoted a whole career to producing high-impact work. That is what would happen ideally, but does that happen in fact? And even if the ideal is closely approximated in most sciences, is it also reasonably attained in psychological science?\u201d (p.888)", "Abstract": "More than a century of scientific research has shed considerable light on how a scientist\u2019s contributions to psychological science might be best assessed and duly recognized. This brief overview of that empirical evidence concentrates on recognition for lifetime career achievements in psychological science. After discussing both productivity and citation indicators, the treatment turns to critical precautions in the application of these indicators to psychologists. These issues concern both predictive validity and interjudge reliability. In the former case, not only are the predictive validities for standard indicators relatively small, but the indicators can exhibit important non-merit-based biases that undermine validity. In the latter case, peer consensus in the evaluation of scientific contributions is appreciably lower in psychology than in the natural sciences, a fact that has consequences for citation measures as well. Psychologists must therefore exercise considerable care in judging achievements in psychological science\u2014both their own and those of others.", "Reference": "Simonton, D. K. (2016).

The typical teaching assignments in research universities are very substantially lower than they were in the days when modern experimental psychology took off.

In a few cases, researchers break out of a discipline to become famous across psychology and (more rarely still) even outside the confines of academe. The progression is slow and uneven.

So if I were to recommend a strategy for up and coming scientists it might be this: develop a research program that combines intrinsic fascination and interest with extrinsic recognition and career advancement. Follow your heart and your head. Explore and develop the riskier, more potentially transformative and creative lines of research at the same time that you develop the safer, more fundable ideas. This might occur by developing two separate lines of research, or better yet, by finding one research program that is both intrinsically motivated and then other people also recognize, appreciate, and reward you for it. If you can do both of these, you stand the best chance of surviving, succeeding, and maybe even becoming famous in the competitive world of academic psychological science\u201d (p.897)", "Abstract": "In this article, I argue that scientific fame and impact exists on a continuum from the mundane to the transformative/ revolutionary. Ideally, one achieves fame and impact in science by synthesizing two extreme career prototypes: intrinsic and extrinsic research. The former is guided by interest, curiosity, passion, gut, and intuition for important untapped topics. The latter is guided by money, grants, and/or what is being published in top-tier journals. Assessment of fame and impact in science ultimately rests on productivity (publication) and some variation of its impact (citations). In addition to those traditional measures of impact, there are some relatively new metrics (e.g., the h index and altmetrics). If psychology is to achieve consensual cumulative progress and better rates of replication, I propose that upcoming psychologists would do well to understand that success is not equal to fame and that individual career success is not necessarily the same as disciplinary success. Finally, if one is to have a successful and perhaps even famous career in psychological science, a good strategy would be to synthesize intrinsic and extrinsic motives for one\u2019s research.", "Reference": "Feist, G.

We conducted a survey of 3759 researchers across a wide range of disciplines to determine the importance of different cues for assessing the credibility of individual preprints and preprint services. We found that cues related to information about open science content and independent verification of author claims were rated as highly important for judging preprint credibility, and peer views and author information were rated as less important.

Given finite resources, the importance placed on novel findings, and the emphasis on a relatively small number of publications, scientists wishing to accelerate their career progression should conduct a large number of exploratory studies, each of which will have low statistical power. Since the conclusions of underpowered studies are highly likely to be erroneous [2], this means that most published findings are likely to be false [5]. The results of our model support this conclusion. Indeed, given evidence that with sufficient analytical flexibility (known as p-hacking) almost any dataset can produce a statistically significant (and therefore publishable) finding [16], our results are likely to be conservative. There is therefore evidence from both simulations and empirical studies that current research practices may not be optimal for the advancement of knowledge, at least in the biomedical sciences.\u201d (p.8).", "Abstract": "We can regard the wider incentive structures that operate across science, such as the priority given to novel findings, as an ecosystem within which scientists strive to maximise their fitness (i.e., publication record and career success). Here, we develop an optimality model that predicts the most rational research strategy, in terms of the proportion of research effort spent on seeking novel results rather than on confirmatory studies, and the amount of research effort per exploratory study. We show that, for parameter values derived from the scientific literature, researchers acting to maximise their fitness should spend most of their effort seeking novel results and conduct small studies that have only 10%\u00b140% statistical power. As a result, half of the studies they publish will report erroneous conclusions.

Particularly germane to Shank and Koehnle\u2019s discussion are the inevitable trade-offs in any decisions to include blocking or to standardize conditions in experiments. Second, the interpretation of multiple tests of a hypothesis is clarified. Only when interest focuses on any, rather than each, of N possible responses is it appropriate to adjust criteria for statistical significance of the results. Finally, a misunderstanding is corrected about a disadvantage of large experiments (Wiley, 2003). Experiments with large samples raise the possibility of small, but statistically significant, biases even after randomization of treatments. Because these small biases are difficult for experimenters and readers to notice, large experiments demonstrating small effects require special scrutiny. Such experiments are justified only when they involve minimal human intervention and maximal standardization.

Many of those who do this work are evaluated on their contributions to science when they apply for a job, a promotion, or a grant. One might expect this evaluation to be based simply on one\u2019s contributions to science. In many fields, evaluation is formally based on the list of publications that include the researcher as an author. But there can be a disconnect between those who are authors and those who make contributions. While author typically means \u201cwriter\u201d, funders and promotion committee members are interested in various types of substantive contributions\u2014who actually provided the words in the paper is, often, not the paramount concern.", "Many journals and societies specifically enshrine manuscript drafting or revising as a requirement for co-authorship. This is a problem for funders and others interested in both writing related contributions and also contributions that are not writing related.", "More broadly, the concept of authorship itself may no longer be appropriate. With standard practice today, the ambiguity regarding the contribution(s) of a co-author to a paper extends well beyond whether there was a contribution to the writing. Surveys of researchers show strong disagreement both with the most widely used authorship guidelines and also high levels of inconsistency between researchers regarding the categories of contributions that merit authorship.", "To resolve the ambiguity in the meaning of author lists, one would have to ask the authors what the contributions were of each author and what, if any, were the significant contributions of others. Under a contributorship model, authors are required to state this information. And in a world where a number of researchers often contribute one or more of a variety of things to a research project, it seems illogical for researchers not to say something about who did what in a way that is visible and systematically enables credit for those contributions.", "The transparency and removal of ambiguity stemming from a declaration of contributions will have multiple benefits. Universities, laboratories, and institutions make hiring and funding decisions based on what they can determine about a person\u2019s past scientific contributions. These hiring organizations can have very different interests in specific kinds of contributions. When hiring a staff scientist in a large laboratory, or a statistician in a research group, one is looking for different types of contributions than if one is hiring a faculty member expected to run a laboratory.

Many journals and publishers have already taken steps in this direction, and further adoption will have several benefits. This article makes the case for continuing to move down that path. Use of a contributorship model should improve the ability of universities and funders to identify effective individual researchers and improving their ability to identify the right mix of researchers needed to advance modern science.

Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, may have modified or selectively used data to support his conclusions [40] and statistical analysis suggests that Mendel\u2019s \u2018\u2018data\u2026 [are] biased strongly in the direction of agreement with expectation\u2026.

Methods and Findings: We examined the interval between publication and retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed. Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among 1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82 months (p < 0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals, but only .1% of the variance in time-to-retraction was explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple retractions was greater in 1972\u20131992 than in the current era (p < 0.001). From 1972\u20131992, 46.0% of retracted papers were written by authors with a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were written by single-retraction authors (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the time-to-retraction of flawed work.", "Reference": "Steen, R.

They are published in our journals, masquerading as successes. The file-drawer explanation becomes transparently implausible once its assumptions are made explicit. It assumes that researchers conduct a study and perform one (predetermined) statistical analysis. If the analysis is significant, then they publish it.", "P-hacking provides the real solution to the paradox. P-hacking is the only honest and practical way to consistently get underpowered studies to be statistically significant.", "P-hacking makes it dramatically easier to generate false-positive findings, so much so that, for decades, p-hacking enabled researchers to achieve the otherwise mathematically impossible feat of getting most of their underpowered studies to be significant. P-hacking has long been the biggest threat to the integrity of our discipline.", "False positives are bad. Publishing them can cause scientists to spend precious resources chasing down false leads, policy makers to enact potentially harmful or ineffective policies, and funding agencies to allocate their resources away from hypotheses that are actually true. When false positives populate the scientific literature, we can no longer distinguish between what is true and what is false, undermining the very goal of science.", "P-hacking is a pervasive problem precisely because researchers usually do not realize that they are doing it or appreciate that what they are doing is consequential. The most straightforward way to prevent researchers from selectively reporting their methods and analyses is to require them to report less selectively. At the bare minimum, this means requiring authors to disclose all of their measures, manipulations, and exclusions, as well as how they determined their sample sizes.", "Overcoming this concern requires realizing that preregistrations do not tie researchers\u2019 hands, but merely uncover readers\u2019 eyes. Preregistering does not preclude exploration, but it does communicate to readers that it occurred. Preregistering allows readers to discriminate between confirmatory analyses, which provide valid p-values and trustworthy results, and exploratory analyses, which provide invalid p-values and tentative results.", "Replications have traditionally been deemed failures when the effect described by the original study is not statistically significant in the replication. This approach has two obvious flaws. First, a replication attempt could be nonsignificant simply because its sample size is too small. Second, a replication attempt could be significant even if the effect size is categorically smaller than in the original.", "To correct selective reporting is p-curve analysis, P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p-values from a set of studies. P-curve\u2019s shape can be used to diagnose whether a literature contains replicable effects.", "Discussions of fraud typically focus on two questions: How common is it and how can we stop it? Estimating the frequency of fraud is very difficult. Some blatantly detectable fraud is prevented by vigilant coauthors, reviewers, or editors and, thus, not typically observed by the rest of the field. The fraud that gets through those filters might be noticed by a very small share of readers. Of those readers, a very small number might ever make their concerns known.", "Meta-analytic thinking has its benefits. It allows inferences to be based on larger and potentially more diverse samples, promotes collaboration among scientists, and incentivizes more systematic research programs. Nevertheless, meta-analytic thinking not only fails to solve the problems of p-hacking, reporting errors, and fraud, it dramatically exacerbates them.", "Why is p values heavily relied upon? The authors think it is because there is actually no compelling reason to abandon the use of p-values. It is true that p-values are imperfect, but, for the types of questions that most psychologists are interested in answering, they are no more imperfect than confidence intervals, effect sizes, or Bayesian approaches. The biggest problem with p-values is that they can be mindlessly relied upon; however, when effect size estimates, confidence intervals, or Bayesian results are mindlessly relied upon, the results are at least as problematic. It is not the statistic that causes the problem, it is the mindlessness."], "Quote": "\u201cIt might make sense for new graduate students to erroneously think 12 participants per cell will be a sufficiently large sample size to test a counterintuitive attenuated interaction hypothesis, but it would not make sense for a full professor to maintain this belief after running hundreds of experiments that should have failed.

This sparked a period of methodological reflection that we review here and call Psychology\u2019s Renaissance. We begin by describing how psychologists\u2019 concerns with publication bias shifted from worrying about file-drawered studies to worrying about p-hacked analyses. We then review the methodological changes that psychologists have proposed and, in some cases, embraced. In describing how the renaissance has unfolded, we attempt to describe different points of view fairly but not neutrally, so as to identify the most promising paths forward. In so doing, we champion disclosure and preregistration, express skepticism about most statistical solutions to publication bias, take positions on the analysis and interpretation of replication failures, and contend that meta-analytical thinking increases the prevalence of false positives. Our general thesis is that the scientific practices of experimental psychologists have improved dramatically.", "Reference": "Nelson, L. D., Simmons, J., & Simonsohn, U. (2018).

Bias may be reinforced by gender subordinating language or differential use of formality in forms of address. Professional titles may influence the perceived expertise and authority of the referenced individual. The objective of this study is to examine how professional titles were used in the same and mixed-gender speaker introductions at Internal Medicine Grand Rounds (IMGR).Methods: A retrospective observational study of video-archived speaker introductions at consecutive IMGR was conducted at two different locations (Arizona, Minnesota) of an academic medical center. Introducers and speakers at IMGR were physician and scientist peers holding MD, PhD, or MD/PhD degrees. The primary outcome was whether or not a speaker\u2019s professional title was used during the first form of address during speaker introductions at IMGR. As secondary outcomes, we evaluated whether or not the speakers professional title was used in any form of address during the introduction.Results: Three hundred twenty-one forms of address were analyzed. Female introducers were more likely to use professional titles when introducing any speaker during the first form of address compared with male introducers (96.2% [102/106] vs. 65.6% [141/215]; p < 0.001). Female dyads utilized formal titles during the first form of address 97.8% (45/46) compared with male dyads who utilized a formal title 72.4% (110/152) of the time ( p = 0.007). In mixed-gender dyads, where the introducer was female and speaker male, formal titles were used 95.0% (57/60) of the time. Male introducers of female speakers utilized professional titles 49.2% (31/63) of the time ( p < 0.001).Conclusion: In this study, women introduced by men at IMGR were less likely to be addressed by professional title than were men introduced by men.
